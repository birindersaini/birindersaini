## 👋 About Me
I’m a T-Level Software Engineering student with a passion for web development and digital design. I enjoy creating websites that are both functional and visually appealing. While I currently do front-end development, I’m also learning back-end development to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.

Here’s a quick overview of me:

💻 **Web Developer:** Building websites that are responsive with Visual Studio Code and the following programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎨 **Graphic Designer:** Creating clean, user-friendly and visually engaging designs.

🛠️ **Currently Learning:** Back-end languages, including SQL and C#.

🚀 **Projects:** Working on real-world projects, combining technical and design skills.

🧠 **Mindset:** Always learning and applying new skills; trying out new languages, testing ideas, and solving errors along the way.


## 🎯 Current Goals

- Expand back-end development skills (SQL, C#).  
- Improve full-stack development knowledge.
- Create real-time, responsive, accessible, and functional web applications
- Strengthen problem-solving and debugging skills


## 👨‍💻 Current Running Projects

Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on:

- **College Full-Stack Project** – Building a business-focused website aligned with given briefs and requirements. Front-end is completed; back-end development is now in progress.

- **Rolls-Royce T-Level Industry Placement Project** – Developing an Absence Planner and Team Management application. Working on both front-end and back-end development as part of my industry placement, contributing to UI design, functionality, and system logic.

- **Personal Learning Website** – A functional, real-time website I’m building to apply what I learn in class. I am working across front-end, back-end, and UI design to deepen my knowledge and strengthen my problem-solving skills.
